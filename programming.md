# Languages

I am extensively familiar with **Python 3**. I am also very familiar with **Java** and **C**. I am currently in progress learning **Haskell**.

I have experience using the following Python 3 libraries:

[Here is my github page.](https://github.com/BlakeSHerrera) Over the years, I have worked on projects that interested me, including:
- An image maker for complex number fractals
- A playable chess game
- A playable board game called Conquest
- Puzzle solvers for games like picross, sudoku, tower of hanoi, candy crush, and brick pop.
- Cool computational geometry patterns

# Competitive Programming

I first began competitive programming in highschool around 2013. After graduating, I did not pick it up again until the Fall of 2022 while pursuing my Bachelor's of Computer Science at UTSA.

My favorite language to use is Python 3. I can keep my code short and sweet, not worrying about the overhead that many other languages have. In fact, I have the shortest solution for a handful of problems. Many common operations are made simple with slicing, generator expressions, and operator overloading.

[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) is a site that hosts competitive programming problems, and it is the main website I use. Check out my kattis profile page [here](https://open.kattis.com/users/blake-herrera)! At the time of writing this page, I have a score of 246.6 and am ranked **3,461 out of ~137,979** users, which puts me in the **top 2.5%** of all users!

## Project Euler <img src="/images/project-euler-logo.png" alt="Project Euler" width="256"/> <img src="/images/project-euler-logo-2.png" alt="Euler" width="96"/>

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a neat website that combines math and number theory with computer science and algorithmic thinking. I mostly did these problems in high school. So far, I have completed 71 problems which puts me in the [**top 2.7%**](https://projecteuler.net/problem_analysis) out of over 1 million users!

## Code Submission Evaluation System

[CSES](http://cses.fi) is a nice collection of problems, arranged by topic. I have been using Kattis mostly, so I have only done the introductory problems on this website. Still, that puts me in roughly the **top 20%** of users.
