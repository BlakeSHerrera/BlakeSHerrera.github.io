My name is Blake Herrera. Welcome to my personal website! Everything here has been programmed myself.

I am a **Junior** at the **University of Texas at San Antonio** pursuing a **Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science**. My estimated graduation date is December of 2023. My goal is to pursue a long-term career with artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. [**Here is my resume**](/documents/Herrera, Blake - Resume.pdf).

The things I like include computer science, strategy games, and playing piano. In fact, I even give lessons for chess, as I am quite good at the game! If you would like chess lessons, please click the button at the top of the page for more information.
