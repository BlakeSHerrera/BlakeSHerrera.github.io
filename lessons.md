# My Teaching Experience

I first learned to play chess and entered my first tournament in my freshman year of highschool. Although I had a late start, I graduated as the highest rated highschool chess player in San Antonio, TX for 2015. My rating continued to grow, and I am currently a Class A player rated over 1800. I have scored tournament victories against some of San Antonio's chess masters during tournaments and am looking forward to becoming one myself.

I have been teaching chess since 2017. I have taught all age groups, from as young as 4 years old to adults above 70 years old! I have instructed after school chess clubs in over a dozen elementary schools around San Antonio, TX, which include private/charter schools and Title I schools. My classroom sizes have been up to 20 students. I have worked with students of seemingly every background and skill level imaginable.

# My Curriculum

The primary focus of my lessons is improving long-term **strategic thinking**, short-term **calculation**, and immediate **pattern recognition**, which are the most important factors for any chess player to be successful. However, I pay a due respect to more than just the moves on the board: I ensure my students have a **well-rounded education** and will be knowledgeable in more than simple strategy. My students will emerge cultured on the game's great history and be able to discuss other topics in chess. Additional topics are outlined below.
- Special tournament rules
- Etiquette and sportsmanship
- History of the game and famous players
- Use of technology for improvement (older students)
- Current events and topics in chess

I also give recommendations for supplemental instructional materials such as books, websites, apps, etc.
